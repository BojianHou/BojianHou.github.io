Welcome to my homepage! My name is Bojian Hou (also Bo-Jian Hou), an **AI Research Scientist** at **Meta**, with a focus on large-scale machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. My current work centers on **ranking**, **recommendation**, and **retrieval**, as well as **large language models (LLMs)** and **multimodal generative AI**.

Before joining Meta, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), where I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Li Shen](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/li-shen-phd-faimbe).  
<!-- I was also affiliated with [CBICA](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/) and previously held a postdoctoral position at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://phs.weill.cornell.edu/) with Prof. [Fei Wang](https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/). -->

I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in 2014 and 2020, respectively. I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/) in the [LAMDA](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx) Group.

As a **machine learning researcher**, I am interested in both the theoretical foundations and real-world applications of AI. My research spans:

- **Interpretability**: studying and improving transparency of black-box machine learning models  
- **Fairness Learning**: developing fair and unbiased machine learning algorithms  
- **Feature Evolvable Learning**: learning with dynamic and shifting feature spaces  
- **Large Language Models**: calibration, uncertainty estimation, and response control  
- **Multimodal Learning**: vision-language modeling and cross-modal retrieval  
- **Recommendation Systems**: multi-stage ranking, retrieval, and user modeling  
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: learning models from both labeled and unlabeled data  
- **Online Learning**: learning models continuously from streaming data  
- **Biomedical Data Mining**: developing machine learning methods for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and mental health

I am passionate about bridging **fundamental ML research** with **real-world deployment**, and designing AI systems that are not only **technically rigorous**, but also **trustworthy and socially responsible**.

<!-- Before that, I was a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Poplulation Health and Science](https://phs.weill.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), advised by Prof. [Fei Wang](https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/). -->

<!-- I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in 2014 and 2020 separately. I was a member of [LAMDA](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx) Group led by Prof. [Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/) during my doctoral study. My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. [Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/). -->

<!-- My research interests mainly focus on trustworthy AI, optimization for AI and AI for science. Specifically, they include: -->
<!-- I have broad interests in machine learning and data mining, and their potential applications to
biomedical data including:  -->

<!--such as medical images, medical literature, and electronic health records (EHR). -->

<!-- During my doctoral studies, I developed a novel learning scenario known as feature evolvable learning,
where data features would evolve in an open and dynamic environment. The goal was to keep optimal
online learning performance in dynamic feature space. I also studied semi-supervised learning and
interpretability problems, such as storage-fit learning with unlabeled data and learning the interpretable
structure from RNNs, respectively.

At my postdoctoral position, I mainly conducted multimodal survival analysis for medical images and
clinical data, built natural language processing models to do medical literature mining, and investigated
the potential issues of the interpretability methodologies for medical data. -->

<!-- I have broad interest in machine learning, data mining and their potential applications to biomedical data. During my doctoral study, my main research direction is **feature evolvable learning** which is a novel learning scenario where data features would evolve in open and dynamic environment. I developed a series of algorithms that can effectively deal with this scenario with theoretical guarantees. I am also interested in -->
<!-- In summary, my research interests include: -->

<!-- - **Interpretability**: studying the interpretability of the black-box machine learning models.
- **Feature Evolvable Learning**: studying learning scenarios where data features evolve.
- **Fairness Learning**: developing fair and unbiased machine learning algorithms.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: learning models from both labeled and unlabeled data.
- **Online Learning**: learning models continuously from online streaming data.
- **Large Language Models**: developing and applying large language models. -->
<!-- - **Deep Learning**: using deep neural networks to handle complex spatial and temporal data. -->
<!-- - **Biomedical Data Mining**: developing machine learning methods to analyze biomedical data (especially for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) and mental health). -->

<!-- <span style="color:red">I am seeking faculty positions for the 2024-2025 academic year, with a focus on computer science, data science, biomedical informatics, and related fields. I welcome inquiries from interested institutions.</span> -->
<!-- - **Learnware**: towards reusable, evolvable and comprehensible machine learning models. -->

<!-- I will use my expertise of machine learning to do research on biomedical image analysis and survival analysis in the future. -->
