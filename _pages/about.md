Welcome to my homepage! My name is Bojian Hou (also Bo-Jian Hou), a postdoctoral researcher of [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) advised by Prof. [Li Shen](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/li-shen-phd-faimbe).

<!-- Before that, I was a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Poplulation Health and Science](https://phs.weill.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), advised by Prof. [Fei Wang](https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/). --> 

<!--[CBICA](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/) (The Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) advised by Prof. [Yong Fan](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/abili/yfan.html). -->

I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in 2014 and 2020 separately. I was a member of [LAMDA](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx) Group led by Prof. [Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/) during my doctoral study. My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. [Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/).

My research interests mainly focus on trustworthy AI, optimization for AI and AI for science. Specifically, they include:
<!-- I have broad interests in machine learning and data mining, and their potential applications to
biomedical data including:  -->

<!--such as medical images, medical literature, and electronic health records (EHR). -->

<!-- During my doctoral studies, I developed a novel learning scenario known as feature evolvable learning,
where data features would evolve in an open and dynamic environment. The goal was to keep optimal
online learning performance in dynamic feature space. I also studied semi-supervised learning and
interpretability problems, such as storage-fit learning with unlabeled data and learning the interpretable
structure from RNNs, respectively.

At my postdoctoral position, I mainly conducted multimodal survival analysis for medical images and
clinical data, built natural language processing models to do medical literature mining, and investigated
the potential issues of the interpretability methodologies for medical data. -->

<!-- I have broad interest in machine learning, data mining and their potential applications to biomedical data. During my doctoral study, my main research direction is **feature evolvable learning** which is a novel learning scenario where data features would evolve in open and dynamic environment. I developed a series of algorithms that can effectively deal with this scenario with theoretical guarantees. I am also interested in -->
<!-- In summary, my research interests include: -->
- **Fairness Learning**: developing fair and unbiased machine learning algorithms.
- **Interpretability**: studying the interpretability of the black-box machine learning models.
- **Feature Evolvable Learning**: studying learning scenarios where data features evolve.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: learning models from both labeled and unlabeled data.
- **Online Learning**: learning models continuously from online streaming data.
- **Natural Language Processing**: developing and applying large language models.
<!-- - **Deep Learning**: using deep neural networks to handle complex spatial and temporal data. -->
- **Biomedical Data Mining**: developing machine learning methods to analyze biomedical data (especially for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD)).

<span style="color:red">I am seeking faculty positions for the 2024-2025 academic year, with a focus on computer science, data science, biomedical informatics, and related fields. I welcome inquiries from interested institutions.</span>
<!-- - **Learnware**: towards reusable, evolvable and comprehensible machine learning models. -->

<!-- I will use my expertise of machine learning to do research on biomedical image analysis and survival analysis in the future. -->
