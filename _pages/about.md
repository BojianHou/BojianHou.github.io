Hi, welcome to my homepage! My name is Bojian Hou (also Bo-Jian Hou), a postdoctoral researcher  in the [Department of Radiology](https://www.pennmedicine.org/departments-and-centers/department-of-radiology) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) advised by Prof. [Yong Fan](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/abili/yfan.html). Before that, I was a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Poplulation Health and Science](https://phs.weill.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, advised by Prof. [Fei Wang](https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/). 

I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in 2014 and 2020 seperately. I was a member of [LAMDA](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx) Group led by Prof. [Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/). My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. [Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/).

I have broad interest in machine learning and data mining and their potential applications to biomedical data. During my doctoral studies, my main research direction is **feature evolvable learning** which is a novel learning scenario where data features would evolve in open and dynamic environment. I developed a series of algorithms that can effectively deal with this scenario with theoretical guarantees. I am also interested in
- **Interpretability**: studying the interpretability of the black-box machine learning models;
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: learning both from labeled and unlabeled data;
- **Online Learning**: learning models continuously from online streaming data;
- **Natural Language Processing**: leveraging pre-trained model to understand natural language;
- **Deep Learning**: leveraging deep neural networks to handle complex spatial and temporal data;
- **Learnware**: towards reusable, evolvable and comprehensible machine learning models.
